// Goal: To free up resources, releases that have not had any recent activity could be deleted without being missed. 
// Requirements:
// - Take the number to keep as a parameter
// - Output the releases that should be kept
// - Log why a release is kept
// - Focus on the algorithm rather than a user interface
